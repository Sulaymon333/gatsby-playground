## Welomce to my Gatsbyjs-website tutorial coding challenge

This is where I track my personal study of Gatsbyjs tutorial from Gatsbyjs website itself. Please switch to different branches to see more on my learnings and projects.

Happy Coding ðŸ˜€

### Run locally

1. **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-hello-world-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

2. **Then check the site locally on**

    `http://localhost:8000`!
